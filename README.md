Project ePortfolio 
1. **FoodHub Data Set analysis using Python [Python Foundations]** : The food aggregation company has collected data on orders placed by its registered customers on their website. They aim to examine this data in order to extract valuable insights for their business. If you were brought on board as a Data Scientist at this firm, the Data Science team has provided a set of important inquiries that require addressing. Your task is to conduct data analysis to uncover solutions to these questions, ultimately aiding the company in enhancing its operations.
2. **E-news Express [Business Analytics]:** This initiative employs a blend of statistical analysis, A/B testing, and data visualization to assess the efficacy of a revamped landing page for the online news platform, E-news Express. Utilizing a simulated dataset with key metrics like conversion rates and page engagement time, the study aims to ascertain whether the new landing page successfully attracts new subscribers. Furthermore, it delves into the correlation between language preferences and conversion rates.

3. **ReCell [Supervised Learning, Pricing Dynamics]:** The ReCell project delves into the world of used and refurbished electronic devices. It involves the analysis of a dataset to construct a predictive model that facilitates the development of a flexible pricing strategy. The model identifies pivotal factors influencing pricing decisions, contributing to informed pricing strategies for these devices.

4. **INN Hotels [Supervised Learning - Booking Management]:** The INN Hotels endeavor focuses on the intricate landscape of booking cancellations in the hospitality industry. Through data analysis, it uncovers the factors significantly impacting booking cancellations and subsequently constructs a predictive model. This model empowers the formulation of proactive policies regarding cancellations and refunds, ultimately enhancing profitability.

5. **EasyVisa [Ensemble Techniques, Visa Approval]:** EasyVisa is a project designed to streamline the visa application process. It delves into applicant data to build a predictive model that optimizes the visa approval process. By pinpointing the key factors influencing visa statuses, the model recommends suitable profiles for visa certification or denial, simplifying decision-making.

6. **ReneWind [Model Tuning, Wind Energy]:** ReneWind, a company dedicated to enhancing wind energy production through machine learning, leverages data on wind turbine generator failures. The primary objective is to construct and fine-tune various classification models to identify failures in advance. By doing so, ReneWind aims to reduce maintenance costs, preemptively addressing generator issues before they result in costly breakdowns.
